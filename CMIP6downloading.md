# How to Manually Download CMIP6 Data â€” Example with Monthly CMIP6 Data ()

### 1 Determine the variables, time resolution, experiments, models, etc.
Registration and login are not required to download CMIP6 data.

The first thing to do is to determine the variables, time resolution, experiments, models that need to be downloaded; 

Then select in the filter bar:

### 2 Select in the filter bar
* Identifiers - Source ID: which model do you want
* Identifiers - Experiment ID: historical or ssp

* Resolutions - Nominal Resolution: the spatial resolution

(Each component (r, i, p, f) is followed by a number that identifies a specific option or method used in that dimension.)

r1: "r" stands for realization. This indicates the ensemble member number and refers to a specific set of initial conditions. Different initial conditions can lead to different climate outcomes due to the chaotic nature of the climate system.
i1: "i" stands for initialization. This number differentiates between the various initial states or the methods used to initialize the model. This might involve slightly different starting points or techniques to estimate the initial state of the model.
p1: "p" stands for physics. This differentiates simulations that use different sets of physical parameters or different configurations of the model physics. Changing physics can help scientists understand how sensitive the model's results are to changes in the representation of physical processes.
f1: "f" stands for forcing. This indicates different external forcings, such as changes in greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosols, or solar radiation. Different forcings can simulate different responses in the climate system.

* Classifications - Frequency: temporal resolution (hour/day/month)
* Classifications - Variable ID: which variable do you want (find the full explaination here: https://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/var.html)
